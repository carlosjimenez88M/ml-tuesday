## About Machine Learning Tuesday


Inspired by the philosophy of [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a space for social data projects, I wanted to create a variant focused not only on Exploratory Data Analysis but on practicing how to develop an end-to-end solution for modeling problems and how to bring them to an output point or API.

* Therefore, the focus of this project remains a __social data project__.

* Sometimes the data shared by TidyTuesday will be used to develop examples and projects.

* The focus is on making developments in Python and underlying technologies.

* There is a navigational path, and it is the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"(Aurélien Géron).

## Project Objectives

* Machine Learning is about constant learning, and the idea is to create a culture around that aspect.

* Implement new technologies and techniques as the problems require.

* Learn to solve problems creatively.
